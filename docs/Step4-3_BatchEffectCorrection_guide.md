# Step4-2. Batch Effect Correction (Optional)

Batch effects arising from technical variation (e.g., sequencing runs or sample processing) can be adjusted either **during normalization (Option A)** or **after normalization (Option B)**.

## Option A. DESeq2 Design Formula
- **Approach**: Include batch as a covariate in the DESeq2 design formula.  
- **Input**: raw counts (from featureCounts or Salmon) + `samples.tsv` with `sample_id`, `condition`, and `batch`.  
- **Design**: `~ batch + condition`  
- **Output**: `vst_design_batch_condition.csv` â€” VST matrix where batch effects are modeled directly.  

ðŸ‘‰ This approach is preferred when batch information is known and can be explicitly modeled during normalization.

## Option B. limma::removeBatchEffect
- **Approach**: Apply batch correction to the already normalized VST matrix.  
- **Input**: `normalized_vst.csv` (from Step 4-2) + `samples.tsv` with `batch`.  
- **Function**: `removeBatchEffect` from the **limma** package.  
- **Design matrix**: Can include condition (e.g., `~ condition`) to preserve biological signal.  
- **Output**: `vst_batchCorrected_limma.csv`  

ðŸ‘‰ This approach is useful when post-hoc correction is preferred, or when multiple downstream methods require an already normalized expression matrix.
